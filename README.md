# TDI Milestone Project

This is the milestone project required in day 10 of the 
12 day program from The Data Incubator. The app 
takes a ticker symbol as input and 
displays a Bokeh graph of the last 30 days price data. 
It uses the Flask framework and is deployed to Heroku. [Here is a direct link](https://daniel-tdi.herokuapp.com/).
